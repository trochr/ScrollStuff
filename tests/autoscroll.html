      If left up to the editors, no new tool would ever be designed
      and no improvements would be possible. They saw no advantage
      to change and couldn't imagine how using a
      computer would make their work easier or better. But if we
      designed the new system in a vacuum, moving ahead without the
      editors' input, we would end up with a
      tool that didn't address their needs.
      Being confident about the value of our innovation was not
      enough. We needed buy-in from the community we were trying to
      serve. Without it, we were forced to abandon our plans.</p>

      Clearly, it wasn't enough for managers to
      have good ideas they had to be able to
      engender support for those ideas among the people
      who'd be charged with employing them. I
      took that lesson to heart.</p>

      <p class="large">
      During the Lucasfilm years, I definitely had my periods of
      feeling overwhelmed as a manager, periods when I wondered
      about my own abilities and asked myself if I should try to
      adopt a more forceful, alpha male management style.
      I'd put my version of hierarchy in place
      by delegating to other managers, but I was also part of a
      chain of command in the greater Lucasfilm empire. I remember
      going home at night, exhausted, feeling like I was balancing
      on the backs of a herd of horses only some
      of the horses were thoroughbreds, some were completely wild,
      and some were ponies who were struggling to keep up. I found
      it hard enough to hold on, let alone steer.</p>
      <p>

      </p><p class="margin20">

        Simply put, managing was hard. No one took
        me aside to give me tips. The books I read that promised
        insight on the topic were mostly devoid of content. So I
        looked to George to see how he did it. I saw that his way
        seemed to reflect some of the philosophy he 
        had put into Yoda. Just as Yoda said things
        like,  Do, or do not. There is no
        try,  George had a fondness for folksy
        analogies that sought to describe, neatly, the mess of
        life. He would compare the often arduous process of
        developing his 4,700-acre Skywalker Ranch compound (a
        minicity of residences and production facilities) to a ship
        going down river that had
        been cut in half and whose
        captain had been thrown overboard.
         We're still going to
        get there,  he would say.
         Grab the paddles and
        let's keep going! 
      </p>

      <p class="margin5">
        
        Another of his favorite analogies was that building a
        company was like being on a wagon train headed west. On the
        long journey to the land of plenty, the pioneers would be
        full of purpose and united by the goal of reaching their
        destination. Once they arrived, he'd
        say, people would come and go, and that was as it should
        be. But the process of moving 
        <em>toward</em> something of having
        not yet arrived was what he
        idealized.</p>
        <p>
        
        Whether evoking wagons or ships, George thought in terms of
        a long view; he believed in the future and his ability to
        shape it. The story has been told and retold about how, as
        a young filmmaker, in the wake of 
        <em>American Graffiti</em>'s success, he
        was advised to demand a higher salary on his next
        movie, 
        <em>Star Wars</em>. That would be the expected move in
        Hollywood: Bump up your quote. Not for George, though. He
        skipped the raise altogether and asked instead to retain
        ownership of licensing and merchandising rights to 
        <em>Star Wars</em>. The studio that was distributing the
        film, 20th Century Fox, readily agreed to his request,
        thinking it was not giving up much. George would prove them
        wrong, setting the stage for major changes in the industry
        he loved. He bet on himself and won.</p>

          L</span>ucasfilm, in those post â€œ
          <em>Star Wars</em> days, was a magnet for big names.
          Famous directors, from Steven Spielberg to Martin
          Scorsese, were always stopping by to see what we were
          working on and what new effects or innovations they might
          use in their films. But more than the drop-ins from
          A-listers, the visit that would stick 
          with me most was the group of Disney
          animators who came for a tour just after
          Valentine's Day, 1983. As I showed
          them around, I noted that one of
          them a kid in baggy jeans named
          John seemed particularly excited about
          what we were up to. In fact, the first thing I noticed
          was his curiosity. When I showed everyone a
          computer-animated image that we were so proud of
          we'd given it a
          name  The Road to
          Point Reyes  he just stood
          there, transfixed. I told him we'd
          developed the image of a gently curving road overlooking
          the Pacific Ocean using a software program
          we'd developed called Reyes (for
          Renders Everything You Ever Saw), and the pun was
          intended: Point Reyes, California, is a seaside village
          on Route 1, not far from Lucasfilm. Reyes represented the
          cutting edge of computer graphics at the time. And it
          bowled this John guy over.

          </p><p>
          Soon, I learned why. He had an idea, he told me, for a
          film called 
          <em>The Brave Little Toaster</em> about a toaster, a
          blanket, a lamp, a radio, and a vacuum cleaner who
          journey to the city to find their master after being
          abandoned in their cabin in the woods. He told me that
          his film, which he was about to pitch to his bosses at
          Disney Animation, would be the first to place hand-drawn
          characters inside computer-generated backgrounds, much
          like the one I'd just shown him. He
          wanted to know if we could work together to make this
          happen.</p>
          <p>
                      
          </p><p>

            That animator was John Lasseter.
            Unbeknownst to me, soon after our meeting at Lucasfilm,
            he would lose his job at Disney. Apparently, his
            supervisors felt that 
            <em>The Brave Little
            Toaster</em> was like
            him a little 
            <em>too</em> avant-garde. They listened to his
            pitch and, immediately afterward, fired him. A few
            months later, I ran into John again on the Queen Mary,
            of all places. The historic Long Beach hotel, which
            also happens to be a docked ocean liner, was the site
            of the annual Pratt Institute Symposium on Computer
            Graphics. Not knowing of his newly unemployed status, I
            asked if there was any way he could come up to
            Lucasfilm and help us make our first short film. He
            said yes without hesitation. I remember
            thinking 
            it was almost as if Professor
            Sutherland's exchange program idea
            was finally getting its moment. To have a Disney
            animator on our team, even temporarily, would be a huge
            leap forward. For the first time, a true storyteller
            would be joining our ranks.

            John was a born dreamer. As a boy, he lived mostly in
            his head and in the tree houses and tunnels and
            spaceships he drew in his sketchbook. His dad was the
            parts manager at the local Chevrolet dealership in
            Whittier, California instilling in
            John a lifelong obsession with
            cars and his mom was a high school
            art teacher. Like me, John remembers discovering that
            there were people who made animation for a living and
            thinking he'd found his place in the
            world. For him, as for me, that realization was
            Disney-related; it came when he stumbled upon a
            well-worn copy of 
            <em>The Art of Animation</em>, Bob
            Thomas's history of the Disney
            Studios, in his high school library. By the time I met
            John, he was as connected to Walt Disney as any
            twenty-six-year-old on earth. He had graduated from
            CalArts, the legendary art school founded by Walt,
            where he'd learned from some of the
            greatest artists of Disney's Golden
            Age; he'd worked as a river guide on
            the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland; and
            he'd won a Student Academy Award in
            1979 for his short film 
            <em>The Lady and the Lamp</em> an
            homage to Disney's 
            <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> whose
            main character, a white desk lamp, would later evolve
            into our Pixar logo.</p>

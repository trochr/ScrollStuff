ScrollStuff
===========

In the great tradition of reinventing the wheel, here is SmartScroll, a bookmarklet to scroll around a web page, in a continuous manner. It detects the words per lines and, knowing your reading speed, will scroll accordingly.


Usage
-----

See the setup instructions on the [homepage](http://trochr.github.io/ScrollStuff/) 


Caveats
------

- Some sites (such as github) block modifications of the DOM by externally loaded script. See more info on [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- Apple Safari (at least on iOS) does not permit the usage of Bookmarklets

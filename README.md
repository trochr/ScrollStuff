ScrollStuff
===========

In the great tradition of reinventing the wheel, here is ScrollStuff, a bookmarklet to scroll around a web page, 
in a continuous manner. Not unlike some middle mouse clicks, but with better precision.


Usage
-----

See the setup instructions on the [homepage](http://trochr.github.io/ScrollStuff/) 


Caveats
------

- HTTPS pages require the bookmarklet to be loaded from a HTTPS path
- Some sites (such as github) block modifications of the DOM by externally loaded script.
